This is a project by Benjamin Spitz and Gavin Stewart, in Conjunction with Charlie Stoddard at the Frontiers of Science Institute.

It aims to create a Java program that will model the flow of boats in a river to optimize traffic patterns and identify conflicts and collisions.

However, the overall mathematical modeling project it is being applied to is a purely theoretical one, derived from the MCM problem from a few years ago.
